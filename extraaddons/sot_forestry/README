Tree Felling: Once trees are registered and yield is approved, then feeling can begin. At this stage
measurement of the log will be taken and captured as; DB1, DB2, DT1, DT2 and Length in order to
calculate the volume of the log. Sometimes when the diameter is extremely small, volume of the log
is derived from Circumference and Length. Hence system should accept values provided by user to
determine volume using either of the following formulas;
1. Log Volume = ((((D1+D2)^2)+((D3+D4)^2))*LENGTH*0.098/1000000
2. Log Volume = ((CIRCUM/3.142)*(CIRCUM/3.142)* LENGTH*0.7854/1000000
PS: Let the fields be such that when Circumference is entered the system will disable diameter
fields; DB1, DB2, DT1, DT2. And also when DB1, DB2, DT1, DT2 are entered Circumference field will
be disabled. Length is always part of either of the formulas to calculate volumes.


is_plantation: Boolean
when is true -> formula will be 2.
else formula will be 1.
